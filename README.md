<h4>Key Terms and Definitions:</h4>

<h5>HTTP:</h5>
Hypertext Transfer Protocol. A binary protocol that originally defined the mechanics of requesting and sending HTML over the internet.

<h5>HTTP Request/Response:</h5>
HTTP, or HyperTextTransferProtocol, is a binary data format for communication between programs over the web.
It can be broken down into two basic message types: requests and responses. Clients send requests for resources to servers, which respond with the requested data.

<h5>HTTP GET and POST:</h5>
Every HTTP request has an important header that determines its method. GET and POST are two of the most common; GET indicates a request for data from the server, 
and POST represents a request to "post" new data to the server - this usually represents some action on server data like submitting search terms, posting an update, or adding new data to the server.

<h5>Web Server:</h5>
A program that listens for and responds to HTTP requests over the internet.

<h5>Application Server:</h5>
A program that hosts other applications, forwarding incoming requests to the appropriate application according to a filter. Provides shared access to resources and multi-threading.

<h5>Pluggable Architecture:</h5>
A pluggable architecture refers to any piece of software that allows parts of it to be added, replaced, and removed. Usually, this is achieved through a common interface for every "pluggable" component. 
Sometimes the architecture can even replace components at runtime, as is the case with Servlets in an Application Server.

<h5>Threads/Threading:</h5>
These terms come from concurrent programming - a thread is essentially one track of computation, and multi-threading is running multiple threads in parallel. This gets a little complicated because your CPU has a limited number of physical cores that can process instructions in parallel, while the number of threads you can have can be many more than your computer has cores, but that's a topic for another time!
